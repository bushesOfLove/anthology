                As I lie on the cold, rugged ground <br>
                bones pinch each other <br>
                from my spines to my throat, cracking, crack. <br>
                In the shades, hungry children and widows <br>
                stare at the heart of the tunnel, <br>
                stone with an edge of frost. <br>
                <br>
                We cannot hold <br>
                <br>
                Stoves fueled by our own blood and flesh, <br>
                in the silent alley of the wretched. <br>
                We know only of sorrow but not of pain, <br>
                for the privileged has left us in vain. <br>
                Approaching sounds of horseshoe stomp on our souls, <br>
                each step beats the foam from our blood. <br>
                Colder than the ground, the <a href="MasterHouse.html">men</a> looked down, <br>
                Without lifting an eye, child not but ant. <br>
                <br>
                We cannot hold<br>
                <br>
                Pray for us, plate to us,<br>
                the last <a href="JavertSoliloquy.html">benevolence</a> in the grasping class.<br>
                Lamarque weaves hope in the cold light of day,<br>
                feeds our children, touches our souls.<br>
                Our fellow men rise to the light, fingers made of wood and steel,<br>
                but our dull minds and bodies cannot heal.<br>
                <br>
                We cannot hold<br>
