                <h3>
                    <span>I am</span> the master of the house,<br>
                    the father of my daughter, the husband of my wife.<br>
                    <span>I wonder</span> what are men but providers of his family.<br>
                    The father belongs no longer to his beliefs, dreams, but to his child.<br>
                    <span>I want</span> a shelter for my daughter and wife<br>
                    in the <a href="WeCannotHold.html">age of suffering</a> and bloodshed.<br>
                    <span>I am</span> the master of the house.<br>
                    They say I am nothing more than mice,<br>
                    scraping off of my unfortunate fellows,<br>
                    clinging on their skins like lice.<br>
                    <span>I say</span> I must feed my child,<br>
                    thus leave no mercy for the wild.<br>
                    <span>I dream</span> not glory nor a higher call,<br>
                    only preserving the place my daughter calls home.<br>
                    <span>I am</span> the master of the house.<br>
